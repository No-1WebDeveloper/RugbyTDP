<header>Rugby on the Whole</header>
<p>Overall, rugby is a contact team sport, played between 2 teams of 15 players, where the ultimate aim is to score more points than the opposition. Originating in England in the early 19th century, rugby was spread all around the world by the British Empire, meaning many British colonies are renowned for their rugby teams. As I will emphasise later on, rugby is commonly divided into 2 categories – rugby Union and rugby league, both of which are versions of rugby with slightly different rules and practises. </p>

<p>Rugby is played with an oval ball which must be brought to the opposite side of the rectangular pitch to score points. However, this is not the only method of gaining points, as they can be achieved through other means as well.
The main idea of rugby is the progression with the ball forwards, but without being able to pass it forwards – aside from kicks. This means that there is very high emphasis on the importance of teamwork and strong formations, in order to defend effectively.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Founding/Origin">
    <header>Founding/Origin</header>
<p>Originating in England in the early 19th century, there are a variety of stories about where the concept of the game emerged from. </p>
<ul>
  <li> 	The most common idea was that in 1823, a student who attended Rugby School flouted the laws of football. He picked up the ball and began to run with it across the field. Nowadays, the distinctive game – watched and played by millions worldwide is said to be all thanks to William Webb Ellis. Although, this story is criticised as having no precise evidence in favour of this story, there was slight mention of this in a report from 1897, about this being the origin of the game. Therefore, the name of the school which Webb Ellis attended, gave its name and influence to the sport, which became known as Rugby football union, when it obtained its first rules in 1845. </li>    

  <li> 	Others argue that the game was around long, long before that, and that it was in existence at the times of ancient civilisations, as the majority of the sports that are played today were founded several thousands of years ago – meaning that this one more than likely would have too.</li>

  <li> 	Also the Roman game of ‘harpastum’ involved the handling of a ball, so could have influenced the rugby which we know today. This game was said to have been played during the 1st century BC when Romans occupied Britain. </li>

  <section class="main-section" id="Scoring">
    <header>Scoring</header>
   <p> Contrastingly to other sports where there is only 1 way to score points (like football); rugby has multiple ways which you can score points, and in different amounts. In rugby there are 3/4 main ways that you can score points during a game. These are:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>	<b>Tries: 5 Points and Conversions: 2 Points</b> – When a player grounds the ball (without dropping it) over their opponents try line within the in-goal area. The place where the ball is put down at a try decides the area which the player can decide where to take their conversion from. After a try is scored, the team which scored it is given the chance to score another 2 points (a conversion) by kicking the ball from a tee over the crossbar, from the area chosen to shoot from. </li>

     <p>Additionally, if a try would have been scored, if it wasn’t for foul play, a penalty try can be awarded, which would still result in the crediting of points to the necessary team. </p>
     
     <li>	<b>Penalty: 3 Points</b> – After foul play from the opposition, a team may be given the chance to shoot at the goal, which if achieved, would earn them 3 points.</li>
   

   <li>	<b>Drop Goal: 3 Points</b> – This is when a player decides that they are close and confident enough to drop the ball and kick it on the half volley directly over the goal when in possession of the ball. This can happen at any time in the game, and are generally unexpected and underestimated, but is also risky, if anticipated by the opposing team.</li>

   </ul>


    </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Positions">
    <header>Positions</header>
  <p>Rugby teams are divided into 2 parts: Forwards and Backs. The forwards are involved in the scrums, and are generally bigger, heavier and stronger. They are numbered 1-8. The backs are more involved in the changing of play, deciding the speed of play and recovering structure. Backs are often smaller, faster, and more athletic than the forwards, and are numbered 9-15. </p>

  <p>Despite these 2 categories, there are different positions within each side, which are detailed below:</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
        <th><u>Forwards</u></th>
        <th><u>Backs</u></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Props: 1&3</b> – The two props in a team are usually the strongest players and help with both defence and attack, meaning that they must have skills in strength, handling and tackling. This is because they must lift the locks in the lineouts, and must be much of the power in the scrums, as they are in the front row. As forwards, they must be strong tacklers to stop attacks and win possession.</td>

        <td><b>Scrum-half: 9</b> – The scrum-half of a team is the connection between the forwards and the backs, and should be one of the best handlers on the team as they need to accurately feed the ball into the scrum, and then collect it when it has got out. They must always be in the correct position and should be there awaiting the winning of rucks as they are fast and good at passing.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Hooker: 2 </b>– The hooker is important in scrums as they are responsible for trying to hook the ball towards their team’s half of the scrum in order to win the play. They must also throw the ball in to their team for lineouts, and therefore must have good accuracy. Additionally, they must have good handling and agility. </td>

        <td><b>Fly-half: 10</b> – The fly-half is the team’s kicker, and they generally control the speed of the game. This is as they must spot opportunities for play and must make integral decisions for the team during gameplay. As the kicker, they must be good at conversions, penalties and general kicks from both hands and from the tee.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Locks: 4&5</b> – The two locks in a team are generally the tallest players and are commonly known as the team’s ‘energy room’. They are lifted up by the props in a lineout, so must have good handling and catching abilities. Also, they must be good tacklers to stop opposition attacks. They use their strength to aid the team with scrums, rucks and mauls. </td>

        <td><b>Centres (inside and outside): 12&13</b> – The two centres quite literally work within the centre of the game, and must move into spaces and step around to make area when on the ball. They must be good at both kicking and passing, and should be good at tackling before the opponents can get the ball to escape from an attack. They must sustain pressure, and energy at all times.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Flankers: 6&7</b> – The two flankers in a team are often the best at competing in rucks and are very fast, as they must follow all aspects of play and must be involved in scrums, rucks and mauls - by supporting the team with strength. They must also be very good at tackling. </td>

        <td><b>Full-back: 15</b> – The full back works as the team’s last line of defence, so must stay behind the team’s lines. They help the team when attacking sometimes, since they are fast and good at catching. They must be confident in kicking the ball long distances to avert danger and must be able to catch well when under pressure.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Number 8: 8</b> – The number 8 in a team is meant to carry the ball through the opposition during attacks and is always supposed to be near the ball, and be able to tackle at all times to win possession of the ball. </td>

        <td><b>Wings: 11 and 14</b> – The two wingers on each team are the fastest on the team and are the ones who generally score tries. They must be able to kick the ball well, both from their hands and from a tee, must be able to spot attacking opportunities, and call for changes to shape the match.</td>
    </tr>

  <section class="main-section" id="How_to_Play">
    <header>How to play</header>
<p>Rugby is played in 2 teams over an 80 minute period (divided into two 40 minute halves). There is never added time like in football, as the clock is just stopped when any decisions are going to be made. Although, each half cannot be ended until the ball goes out of play.</p>

<p>The game begins with one team kicking to a team that receives. The team with the ball then moves up the pitch forwards, to attempt to ground the ball on the other team’s try line (score a try).Meanwhile, the other team tries to tackle the opponent and win possession of the ball so that they can score tries and therefore score points. </p>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Phases_of_Play">
    <header>Phases of Play</header>
  <p><b>During the game, there are different phases of play:</b></p>
 <ul>
   <li>	<b>Scrums:</b> When a minor rule is broken, a scrum is used to restart the play. This can be caused if the ball gets stuck or cannot be used in play – e.g. in a ruck or a maul. This is done by the each team making a structured positioning, where the forwards from each team push against each other to win the ball by winning more ground. The scrum-half throws the ball into the scrum to start it, and goes around the side of the scrum to take it if their team wins the ball. If a scrum is purposefully collapsed, the team that collapsed it could be sanctioned by the referee and it is generally done by awarding the other team with a penalty – either a ‘tap and go’ or a penalty shot at the goal.</li>
   
   <br>

   <li>	<b>Rucks:</b> In rucks, 1 or more players from each team compete to win the ball after a player is tackled and they present the ball. This is because when a player is tackled and go to ground, they must release it – either by popping it off to a teammate, or by going to ground and presenting the ball. When they release the ball, there is potential for the ball to be won by the opposition, as they can go over the tackled person and hook it towards them with their foot, or push an opponent off the ball if they are there too. Nobody can put their hands into the ruck unless the ball is won by their team. This is when the scrum-half takes it out of the ruck and passes it out to an attacking line, which hopes to advance. </li>

   <br>

   <li> 	<b>Mauls:</b> For mauls, a player has the ball and is held up by an opponent, but their teammate comes and tries to help them push past. This can become much bigger, when more and more players from both teams get involved. This is most common when a team is close to their opponent’s try line and they are desperately trying to hold them out from getting the try. It is only classified as a maul if the ball doesn’t touch the ground.</li>

   <br>

   <li> 	<b>Lineouts:</b> When the ball is knocked into touch, the opposite team wins the chance to throw the ball back into play. The team taking the lineout decides how many men they have in the lineout, and they line up on one side – opposite to the other team, with a metre gap between them. This means that their hooker stands on the line and throws the ball straight into the middle of the two lines, where the two teams’ forwards contest for the ball. The tallest player – usually a lock - is lifted to contest for the ball. This then restarts play.</li>

    <header>Rugby Union V Rugby League</header>
 <p>Rugby is commonly divided into 2 different forms of rugby, both with different backstories, and slightly different rules and practises. These two are known as rugby league, and rugby union. </p>   


<p><b>Rugby union</b> – This is the more popular version of the game. This rules set is used for tournaments like the Rugby World Cup and the 6 Nations. Rugby Union was the original game of rugby, and was founded in the way that it was described earlier on. </p>



<p><b> Rugby League</b> – This is the less popular version of the game which was founded in 1871. This was when rugby associations had split from football associations and games were being played in the name of rugby. The split from standardised game of rugby was due to working class men playing, and ending up injured from playing the game too hard. This meant that they had to take time off from work and pay their own doctors bills, and at one point, businesses who had these men employed called out rugby clubs for paying their players for time off of work – meaning they were playing professionally. Therefore, a competition emerged between teams that wished to move on from being amateur, and a division started</p>

<p> Although the rugby league was born from the traditional game of rugby, it has some fairly different rules to the standard game: </p>

    <header>Rugby Variations</header>
    
<p>Since rugby is played by millions around the world, at different times of the year, by people of all ages and abilities, there are many different types of rugby which are specialised for different ages, terrains and abilities. </p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Sevens</b> – Sevens rugby is a 7-a-side variation of rugby, where the two teams play standard rugby over two 7 minute halves. This is a faster variation of rugby and is used in the Olympic Games. A noticeable difference with this type of rugby is that it is conversions are not taken from the tee and instead are taken by a dropkick from the place where it would have been taken from before. </li>
  <code></code>
  <li><b>Beach</b> – Beach rugby is played on sand with smaller teams of 4 or 7. The games are played on a smaller pitch than rugby union or rugby league, and the game period is played over 5/7 minute halves</li>
  <code></code>
  <li><b>Snow</b> – Snow rugby is played with similar rules to standard rugby, only with an adapted kit, more suited for the terrain. The teams are split into 7s and play over 2, 5 or 7 minute halves to keep the game intense and exciting. </li>
<code></code>
  <li><b>Wheelchair</b> – Wheelchair rugby is played inside, and is played by wheelchair users over four 8 minute quarters. This is a sport at the Paralympic Games, and is very popular. The game is played in stronger wheelchairs, and because of the level of roughness, the game is known as ‘murderball’.</li>
    
<code></code>
  <li><b>Tag</b> – Tag rugby is a non-contact alternative to rugby, which still is made up of similar rules. Split into two 5/7 teams, they play in 20 minute halves with the same objective as standard rugby. Each player wears 2 tags on their belt, and they are targeted by defenders in place of tackles. 6 steals of them and the ball is turned over to the other team. </li>
<code></code>
  <li><b>Touch</b> – Touch rugby is played in teams of 6, where instead of tackling the ball carrier on the other team; they must be touched with both hands by the defender. When touched, the player must ground the ball and step over it. 6 touches and the play is turned over to the other team. Play is then started in the centre, where they touch the ball on the ground and begin. NO KICKS ALLOWED!</li>
 
<code></code>
  <li><b>Mini</b> – Mini-rugby is played by children under the age of 13. This is a simple version of rugby union, where there are smaller teams, a smaller pitch and a smaller ball. The pitch size is affected by the age of the players though, and team numbers can vary from 5 to 13 players. </li>
